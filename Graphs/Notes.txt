Graphs Notes.

Edge - connecting two Nodes

Undirected graph - Conncected to both Nodes
Degree - No. of edges connected to one Node

Directed graph - Can go from one node to another(in a  single direction)
Indegree - edge coming towards the node
outdegree - edge going outside the node.

Weighted Graph - On edge there are some weights. Like edge between a and b have a weight of 3.

Path - The distance travelled from one node to another(Unique nodes)

Cyclic Grah - A cycle will be formed.

We can implement it using - adjacencey matrix and adjacency list.
